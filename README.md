# Advent of code 2021

These are the solution to the Advent of code 2021 in Python.

The goal of this repo is to show some practical live coding and how a problem is solved quickly, and how issues are troubleshoot.

There's no nice test or formatting, except for some typos or docstrings I keep the resulting code as it looks like at the end of the video.
